My very first project via The Odin Project curriculum.

## Personal Notes
This project was created during the second week of starting TOP. I'm currently writing this readme after finishing my fourth week. Looking back, the overall javascript code is very much spaghetti. However, working on this project helped me learn a lot about CSS animations, event listeners, and cloning nodes.
